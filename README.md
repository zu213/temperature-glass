<img alt="Example fo tempreature glass" src="./media/tempglass.png" width="500" />

Add a C# overlay form that shows the current average tempreature of the computer's cores.

<u>**This is built for Windows**</u>

## Setup

The program is built for x64 Windows machine and can be started by running : 

`.\TempGlass\bin\Debug\net48\win-x64\TempGlass.exe`

<u>**with Administrator priviledges**</u> (needed to access core tempreature).

Crucially it relies on `OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll` so the .exe may not work if moved on it own outside of this folder.

It is most easily exited by use of task manager `ctrl + shift + esc` and locating `TempGlass.exe` and force closing.

## Setting up to run on login (Windows 10)

1)  Press Win + R, type `taskschd.msc`, and press enter, Task Scheduler will open.
2)  In Task Scheduler click Create Basic Task.
3)  Enter a name and click Next.
4)  Select "When I log on" and click Next.
5)  Select "Start a program" and click Next.
6)  Click Browse, select `.\TempGlass\bin\Debug\net48\win-x64\TempGlass.exe`, and click Next.
7)  Tick "open the Properties dialog..." and then click Finish.
8)  Within the Properties dialog, check "Run with highest privileges".
